## 💡 My Contributions

This project was developed as part of a team of 3 students. I personally contributed:

- Implemented the Sub-GHz RF signal handling logic
- Interfaced IR receiver and created decoding routines
- Integrated I2C communication with OLED display for feedback
- Debugged GPIO output handling with custom button logic
